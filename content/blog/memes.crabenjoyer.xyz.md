This is the realisation of a probject I've been wanting to do for ages but could never be bothered
to put in the effort to spin up. Given how easy Fly.io made hosting this blog, I'd figure it's a
good excuse to try out their Object Storage offering, Tigris Object Storage.

I stumbled upon this through [Xe Iaso's Blog post](https://xeiaso.net/blog/2024/xedn-tigris/) regarding
a CDN using Tigres as the backing for the storage, and it seems like exactly what I need.

Now, I just need to spin up the web server to ingest and deliver the memes across the world - to a device near you.
