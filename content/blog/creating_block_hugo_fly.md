So, this is one of those`yet another personal site` blogs. Except instead of trying to make this as complex as possible to flex my `nerd skills`, we're taking it back to basics and letting other people do most of the work for us.

To deploy a blog, you're going to follow the following steps:
1. Install Hugo
1. Pick a Theme
1. Create the template of the site
1. Install Fly.io's CLI
1. Run `fly deploy`
1. ???
1. Profit - you have a personal site deployed and publically accessible.

There are a few more steps hidden in there but thats really the gist of it all, so lets get into it.
